/**
 * guard-no-any.mjs
 *
 * Bans `any` and its laundered forms from every TypeScript tree in the repo.
 *
 * WHY A SCRIPT AND NOT THE COMPILER: TypeScript has no flag for this. `any` is
 * a deliberate escape hatch, so tsc accepts it silently — which means
 * tsconfig.tests.json can report zero errors over a file that has told the
 * compiler 77 lies. The gate we added is only as strong as the number of
 * escape hatches beneath it. Normally this rule lives in eslint
 * (@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any), but lint is deliberately not a CI step
 * in this repo, so it lives here instead, next to the other guards.
 *
 * WHAT COUNTS AS A VIOLATION:
 *   as any / : any / <any> / Array<any> / Promise<any> ...
 *     Direct escape hatches.
 *   as unknown as X
 *     The same lie with extra steps. `unknown` is only useful when you then
 *     NARROW it; a double cast skips the narrowing and is strictly worse than
 *     `as any` because it looks disciplined.
 *   @ts-ignore
 *     Suppresses an error without proving it exists, and never expires.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY ALLOWED:
 *   @ts-expect-error, but only with an explanatory comment on the line above.
 *   Tests that feed intentionally malformed values to prove a validator
 *   rejects them cannot be expressed in the type system by definition. Unlike
 *   @ts-ignore this fails loudly once the error stops happening, so it cannot
 *   rot into a silent no-op.
