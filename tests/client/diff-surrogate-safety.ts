/**
 * Guards the one place YAOS mutates a Y.Text at partial indices.
 *
 * THE HAZARD
 *
 * Y.Text indices address UTF-16 code units, so an edit boundary can fall
 * between the halves of a surrogate pair.  A diff algorithm working on code
 * units can produce exactly that: replacing 💩 (U+1F4A9 = D83D DCA9) with 😀
 * (U+1F600 = D83D DE00) shares the high surrogate D83D, so a naive longest-
 * common-subsequence pass emits
 *
 *     EQUAL  D83D  /  DELETE DCA9  /  INSERT DE00
 *
 * Applying that splits the Yjs Item mid-character and leaves a lone surrogate.
 * The document still reads back correctly in memory, so nothing looks wrong —
 * but a lone surrogate has no UTF-8 representation, so encoding the document to
 * an update and decoding it again silently substitutes U+FFFD.  The corruption
 * only appears after a persistence round trip.
 *
 * WHY THERE IS NO SANITISER HERE
 *
 * fast-diff already does this.  Its exported entry point hardcodes
 * `fix_unicode = true` (diff.js: `return diff_main(text1, text2, cursor_pos,
 * cleanup, true)`), and diff_cleanupMerge then "shaves off stray surrogates
 * from the end of the previous equality and the beginning of this equality",
 * rolling them into the surrounding delete/insert blocks.  That is precisely
 * the sanitisation the hazard calls for, so adding our own pass would duplicate
 * it and risk disagreeing with it.
 *
 * These tests exist because that is an assumption about a dependency.  A
 * version bump, a swap to another diff library, or a new partial-index mutation
 * would break it silently and only surface as mangled emoji in users' notes
 * days later.
 *
 * The canary at the end applies a deliberately unsanitised patch through the
 * same loop, proving the detector actually fires rather than passing vacuously.
