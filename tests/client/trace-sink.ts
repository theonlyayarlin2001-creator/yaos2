/**
 * Tests for TraceSink infrastructure.
 *
 * Proves:
 * - FlightTraceSink maps domain events to flight events correctly
 * - NoopTraceSink drops events
 * - Domain event kinds map to correct FLIGHT_KIND constants
 * - Unknown domain events are silently dropped
 * - recordPath is non-blocking (no Promise returned to caller)
 * - record() increments droppedEventCount (non-path events not yet mapped)
 * - Every PRODUCT_EVENT_KIND string value has a matching FLIGHT_KIND entry
 *   (compatibility — events may bypass the adapter but their strings must
 *   remain valid within the flight taxonomy)
 *
 * SCOPE / MIGRATION STATUS:
 *
 *   FlightTraceSink.recordPath() is the domain→flight ADAPTER. It maps 12
 *   domain event kinds (rename, disk observation, CRDT lifecycle, reconcile
 *   deferred) to the flight schema. These events originate from main.ts's
 *   vault event handlers via this.traceSink.recordPath().
 *
 *   Most PRODUCT_EVENT_KIND values (recovery.*, reconcile.start/complete/
 *   safety-brake, editor.*, disk.write.*) bypass the adapter entirely — they
 *   are emitted as fully-formed ProductFlightPathEventInput objects directly
 *   through plugin.recordFlightPathEvent(). They already carry kind, source,
 *   layer, and priority and need no adapter mapping.
 *
 *   What is NOT yet migrated to TraceSink (and is explicitly deferred):
 *   - diskMirror.ts: emits disk.write.ok/failed via raw flight callbacks
 *   - main.ts: provider.connected/disconnected/sync.complete via recordFlightEvent
 *   - Full domain-event type coverage (only ~12 of ~47 flight kinds go through TraceSink)
 *
 *   These tests DO NOT claim that all product events route through TraceSink.
 *   They prove: (A) adapter mapping is exhaustive for its 12 domain kinds,
 *   (B) product event strings remain compatible with flight taxonomy strings,
 *   (C) unmapped/non-path events are dropped observably.
