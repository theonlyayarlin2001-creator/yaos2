/**
 * Phase 1.6 — Recovery amplifier orchestration test.
 *
 * The "recovery amplifier" was the scariest class of user-reported data
 * corruption: content duplicated or overwritten every few seconds, triggered
 * by external disk edits while a file was editor-bound.
 *
 * Two distinct amplifier mechanisms existed:
 *
 *  A. diskMirror loop — recovery transaction classified as REMOTE → diskMirror
 *     schedules a disk write → write triggers reconciliation → recovery runs
 *     again → infinite loop of disk writes and reconciliations.
 *     Fixed: Phase 1.1 (recovery origins added to LOCAL_STRING_ORIGINS).
 *
 *  B. Editor heal contamination — after disk recovery sets CRDT=disk, the
 *     editor binding saw CRDT changed and called heal() (editor→CRDT), applying
 *     stale editor content on top of the recovered disk content.
 *     Fixed: repair() path (CRDT→editor, CRDT unchanged) is used instead of
 *     heal() (editor→CRDT) in maybeHealBinding().
 *
 * This test covers known mechanism A invariants at the Yjs/origin layer:
 *   - Every recovery origin string is classified as local by isLocalOrigin()
 *   - The diskMirror dispatch simulation skips writeback for all repair origins
 *   - The diskMirror dispatch simulation triggers writeback for provider (remote) origins
 *   - A recovery transaction produces a non-empty delta on the first pass and an
 *     empty delta on the second pass (idempotent — no amplification loop)
 *
 * This test also exercises the three-authority scenario (disk / CRDT / editor)
 * and documents the still-dangerous heal() path to contrast against the safe
 * repair() path. The repair() path is exercised at the application logic level
 * (tests/contracts/editor-binding-health-regressions.mjs); this test covers the Y.js
 * invariants that underpin it.
 *
 * COVERAGE BOUNDARY — this is Yjs/origin-layer coverage, not controller orchestration.
 * It proves the known writeback-loop mechanism cannot recur through the tested path.
 * Full controller orchestration coverage (ReconciliationController + EditorBinding +
 * DiskMirror observer/queue) is tracked in FU-14.
 *
 * SCOPE — what this test does NOT cover (requires full Obsidian runtime):
 *   - Actual DiskMirror/ReconciliationController lifecycle
 *   - EditorBinding repair/heal flow end-to-end
 *   - Disk write scheduling and flush-queue side effects
 *   - Provider reconnect triggering second reconciliation
