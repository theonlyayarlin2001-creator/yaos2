/**
 * Fencing for the product debug port.
 *
 * `YaosDebugPort` (src/telemetry/debug/ports/yaosDebugPort.ts) is the read-only
 * capability surface the product exposes for debugging. The invariant this file
 * defends is one-directional and belongs to yaos: **no mutating, scenario-control
 * or policy-override capability may appear on the product port.**
 *
 * The mirror-image assertion — that the QA harness implementation satisfies
 * `YaosUnsafeQaPort` — is a compile-time check inside the harness itself
 * (`qa/harness/qaDebugApi.ts`, verified by `tsconfig.qa.json`). It is not
 * restated here, because a runtime test cannot check assignability: this suite
 * runs under jiti, which erases types. A previous version of this file mocked
 * `YaosUnsafeQaPort` and passed for months while its mock had drifted from the
 * real port — the erased annotation checked nothing.
 *
 * `guard:qa-isolation` is likewise not spawned here. `test:regressions` runs it
 * directly before this suite, and CI runs it again; a third invocation proved
 * nothing.
