// Guard for the test-discovery contract.
//
// The regression runner discovers suites by convention — every `*.{ts,mjs}`
// file in tests/client/, tests/server/, tests/contracts/ or tests/live/ —
// instead of reading a hand-maintained array. That only stays trustworthy if
// two invariants hold, and both are checked here:
//
//   1. ACCOUNTABILITY — every discovery candidate is either a real suite (one
//      that can actually fail) or named in tests/suites.json with a non-empty
//      reason. This is the invariant the old array was supposed to hold and
//      didn't: 17 of the 107 files on disk were unregistered, and two of them
//      (file-meta-decode.ts, file-meta-lazy-write.ts — 146 assertions against
//      src/sync/fileMeta.ts) had never executed a single time.
//
//   2. NO ROT — every path named in tests/suites.json still exists and is
//      still a discovery candidate. Without this, a deny-list entry outlives
//      the file it excused, and the next file to take that name inherits the
//      exemption silently.
//
// The runner's own discovery functions are imported rather than reimplemented,
// so this suite cannot pass against a copy that has drifted from production.

// A suite is a file that can fail: it asserts, it throws, or it propagates a
// non-zero exit status from something it delegates to. A file in tests/ with
// no failure path is either a helper that should be named in suites.json, or a
// suite that asserts nothing and reports green forever — both are the same
// coverage hole the hand-maintained array used to produce, just louder.
//
// All idioms in this repo are covered: the shared harness (`s.check(…)`,
// `s.test(…)` from tests/harness.ts), raw `node:assert` calls, `throw new
// Error`, and the delegating wrapper in snapshot-r2-runner.mjs
// (`process.exit(result.status ?? 1)`). `process.exit(0)` and bare
// `process.exit()` deliberately do NOT count — they cannot express failure.
// A file that only calls `s.done()` does not count either: draining an empty
// queue is exactly the green-and-empty suite this guard exists to catch.
