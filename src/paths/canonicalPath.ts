/**
 * Canonical path identity — the single owner of "what is a path" in this repo.
 *
 * Every subsystem that needs to compare, store, or key by vault path should
 * go through this module. Ad hoc normalization outside this module is tech debt.
 *
 * Current normalization:
 *   - Backslashes → forward slashes
 *   - Collapse multiple slashes
 *   - Strip repeated leading "./"
 *   - Strip leading "/"
 *   - Unicode NFC normalization
 *
 * NOT included in this phase:
 *   - Case folding (platform-dependent product decision, deferred)
 *   - Trailing slash behavior (vault paths are files, not dirs)
