/**
 * Connection fact derivation for Phase 1.4.
 *
 * This module is intentionally Obsidian-free so it can be tested under Node.
 * `deriveSyncFacts()` is a pure function: given a snapshot of sync state, it
 * returns the decomposed connection facts that honest status reporting requires.
 *
 * Design notes:
 *
 *   serverReachable — null when unknown (no connection established AND no auth
 *     response received). True when either the WebSocket is open OR we received
 *     any fatal auth response from the server (both mean the network can reach
 *     it). We do not perform HTTP probes; this field reflects what we know from
 *     WebSocket + auth messages only.
 *
 *   authAccepted — null when unknown. True only when websocketOpen (WebSocket
 *     open implies server accepted the token and vaultId). False only when the
 *     server explicitly sent a rejection code.
 *
 *   lastLocalUpdateWhileConnectedAt — the strongest honest claim we can make about
 *     outbound candidates today. A local Y.Doc update that happened while the
 *     WebSocket was open is "eligible" to have been sent — but we have no provider-
 *     level send hook or server receipt to prove it was actually delivered. Do NOT
 *     label this "sent" in UI copy. See docs/sync-contract.md for the permitted
 *     receipt claims.
 *
 *   pendingLocalCount — null always until a real server ack/queue mechanism exists.
 *     "Connected" only means transport is open; it does not prove the outbound
 *     buffer was flushed, the server received the update, or the update persisted.
 *     See FU-8. Do NOT set this to 0 merely because websocketOpen is true.
