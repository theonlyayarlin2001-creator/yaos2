/**
 * Flight envelope — the record shape of the exported trace format.
 *
 * Companion to ./flightTaxonomy.ts: the taxonomy names the events, this
 * module describes the line they are serialised into. One NDJSON line of an
 * exported trace is one `FlightEvent`.
 *
 * Lives in observability/ rather than telemetry/debug/ for the same reason as
 * the taxonomy: the exported file is a user-facing artifact, so its shape is
 * a product-owned contract and not an implementation detail of the recorder
 * that writes it.
 *
 * Kept separate from ./traceSink.ts on purpose. traceSink.ts is the in-process
 * port — what product code is allowed to hand to the recorder. This file is
 * the persisted record. They change for different reasons: adding an envelope
 * field is a format change, widening the port is not.
 *
 * `eventSchemaVersion` versions this shape; `taxonomyVersion` versions the
 * vocabulary. They move independently.
