/**
 * Flight taxonomy — the published vocabulary of the exported trace format.
 *
 * A user turns on debug mode, reproduces a bug, and hands the resulting
 * NDJSON file to a maintainer or an LLM. This module is the vocabulary that
 * file is written in, so it is owned by the product, not by the recorder that
 * happens to serialise it. `src/telemetry/debug/*` consumes this module; it
 * does not define it.
 *
 * WIRE CONTRACT. Every string value below appears verbatim in exported
 * traces and in the analyzer rules under `qa/analyzers/`. Changing a value is
 * a breaking format change, not a rename:
 *
 *   - Adding, removing or renaming a kind REQUIRES bumping
 *     FLIGHT_TAXONOMY_VERSION.
 *   - Never repurpose an existing string for a different event.
 *   - The key (e.g. `crdtFileCreated`) is a compile-time handle and may be
 *     renamed freely; the value (`"crdt.file.created"`) may not.
 *
 * `PRODUCT_EVENT_KIND` in ./productEventKinds.ts is a narrowed view of
 * FLIGHT_KIND — the subset product runtime code is permitted to emit. It
 * references these constants rather than repeating their strings.
