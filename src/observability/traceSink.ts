/**
 * TraceSink — domain-level observability interface.
 *
 * Sync/runtime code emits domain events through this interface.
 * The flight recorder becomes an adapter (FlightTraceSink) that maps
 * domain events to the existing flight event schema.
 *
 * Design rules:
 *   - record() and recordPath() are non-blocking. They never return promises.
 *   - flush() is the only async/durability boundary.
 *   - Callers never need to await trace completion.
 *   - Implementation may queue async work (HMAC, redaction) internally.

// Product event input types
//
// These are capability-narrowed *views* of the canonical envelope in
// ./flightEnvelope.ts, not parallel declarations of it. Every member is
// derived with Extract<> from the published taxonomy, so the two cannot
// drift and each view fails closed: if a taxonomy member is renamed the
// narrowed union loses it and the offending product callsite stops
// compiling, rather than silently inheriting a capability.
//
// Because every field is a subset of the canonical field,
// ProductFlightEventInput is assignable to FlightEventInput and
// ProductFlightPathEventInput to FlightPathEventInput. That is what lets
// the recorder entry points take a single parameter type instead of a
// union of the two spellings.
