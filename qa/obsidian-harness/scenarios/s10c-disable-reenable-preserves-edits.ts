/**
 * S10c — Issue #22: offline edits survive reconnect (disk authority).
 *
 * Purpose: Prove that edits made while YAOS is disconnected are preserved
 * when the provider reconnects, and are NOT overwritten by stale CRDT state
 * from the server.
 *
 * This targets the user report: "I tried turning off the YAOS plugin, then
 * after completing the note turned it back on, only to LOSE ALL MY EDITS."
 *
 * Mechanism:
 *   1. Create file, sync to server, confirm receipt.
 *   2. Go fully offline (setQaNetworkHold("offline")).
 *   3. Open file in editor, type substantial new content.
 *   4. Wait for Obsidian to autosave (disk has new content, CRDT is local-only).
 *   5. Reconnect (setQaNetworkHold("online")).
 *   6. Wait for full idle + receipt.
 *   7. Assert: disk edits survived, disk == CRDT, no conflict copies.
 *
 * What this proves:
 *   After reconnect, the authoritative reconciliation does NOT overwrite
 *   local disk edits with stale server CRDT state. The local edits propagate
 *   to CRDT and then to the server.
 *
 * What this does NOT prove:
 *   - Actual plugin disable/enable lifecycle (requires Obsidian plugin reload)
 *   - Multi-device convergence after reconnect
 *   - Mobile app suspension/resume
 *
 * Bug class: Issue #22 (reconnect data loss variant).
