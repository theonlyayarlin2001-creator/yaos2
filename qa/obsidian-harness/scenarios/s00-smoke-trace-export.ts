/**
 * S00 — Smoke: harness readiness + flight trace machinery.
 *
 * This is the required harness liveness gate.
 * Run it before any other scenario. If this fails, nothing else is meaningful.
 *
 * What it proves:
 *   - window.__YAOS_DEBUG__ is mounted (harness reached the product plugin)
 *   - window.__YAOS_QA__ is mounted (harness plugin itself is running)
 *   - waitForQaReady() passed (both globals exist)
 *   - QA product build is loaded (getEngineControlPort guard passed during mount)
 *   - Harness plugin is loaded (QA console API is registered)
 *   - getConnectionState() returns a sensible string (debug API is callable)
 *   - The harness runner can start a trace, export it, and return a non-null path
 *     (proven by the harness runner's own trace lifecycle around this scenario)
 *
 * Intentionally stateless:
 *   - No files created, modified, or deleted.
 *   - No server state required or assumed.
 *   - No CRDT convergence assertions.
 *
 * Trace lifecycle is managed by the product: recording follows settings.debug,
 * which the prepared QA vault sets to true. The harness runner only exports:
 *   setup → run → assert → exportTraceWithAnalyzer → cleanup
 * This scenario does NOT call exportFlightTrace itself.
 * The controller checks result.tracePath after qa.run() returns.
