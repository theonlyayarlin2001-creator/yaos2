/**
 * ObsidianInternalsPort — the undocumented Obsidian surfaces the QA harness reads.
 *
 * obsidian.d.ts declares the public plugin API. Three things the harness cannot
 * do without are absent from it:
 *
 *   - app.plugins.plugins  — the loaded-plugin registry, how the harness reaches
 *     the product plugin instance it drives (qa/obsidian-harness/main.ts) and how
 *     it reports installed versions (qa/obsidian-harness/api.ts).
 *   - app.commands         — command execution by id and the command-id list,
 *     used to drive real command-palette paths (qa/obsidian-harness/editor-ops.ts).
 *   - MarkdownView._filePath — the last path a view was bound to, which survives
 *     the file being deleted (at which point `view.file` is null).
 *
 * These exist at runtime; only the declaration is missing. So this module
 * declares the shape once, checks it once at the boundary, and hands callers
 * ordinary typed values. That keeps the reads at the call sites cast-free, and
 * — because each accessor validates before it returns — an Obsidian release that
 * moves one of these surfaces to a new name becomes a named error instead of a
 * `TypeError: undefined is not an object` in the middle of a scenario.
 *
 * Nothing here mutates. Scenario control and unsafe mutation live in
 * ./yaosUnsafeQaPort.ts; the product plugin's own private surface lives behind
 * the ProductInternals shape in qa/obsidian-harness/main.ts.
