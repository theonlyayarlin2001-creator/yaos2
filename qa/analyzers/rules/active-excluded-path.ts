/**
 * Rule: active-excluded-path
 *
 * No CRDT file should become (or remain) active under an excluded path prefix.
 * Excluded paths include .trash/, .obsidian/, and user-configured exclude patterns.
 *
 * Fires a hard failure if crdt.file.created, crdt.file.renamed, or crdt.file.revived
 * is observed for a path marked `excludedByPolicy: true` in the event data, AND no
 * tombstone follows within the window (outside the cleanup phase).
 *
 * This rule works in both safe-mode and full traces because it reads `data.excludedByPolicy`
 * rather than the raw path. The product embeds this flag in `recordFlightPathEvent`
 * (main.ts) at the event source, where the exclusion policy is known.
 *
 * Backward compatibility: traces emitted before `excludedByPolicy` was added to events
 * (pre-QA-9 fix) will not have this field. For those traces the rule falls back to
 * checking raw paths (if available) against known always-excluded prefixes (.trash/,
 * .obsidian/). If neither is available, a coverage warning is emitted.
 *
 * Architecture note: this invariant is enforced in the product by
 * onRenameBatchFlushed → vaultSync.handleDelete for excluded destinations.
 * If this rule fires, that guard has failed or a new admission path exists
 * that bypasses the post-rename policy enforcement.
