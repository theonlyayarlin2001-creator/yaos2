/**
 * Rule: orphan-after-rename
 *
 * disk.rename.observed is now emitted as TWO events sharing the same opId:
 *   - renameRole: "source" (oldPath → oldPathId)
 *   - renameRole: "target" (newPath → newPathId)
 *
 * After both fire, the trace should show:
 *   (a) crdt.file.renamed with newPathId
 *   (b) NO crdt.file.created for newPathId after the rename (identity lost)
 *   (c) NO crdt.file.tombstoned for newPathId before the cleanup phase
 *
 * Phase-marker logic:
 *   Tombstones that happen during the cleanup phase (after qa.phase{phase:"cleanup"})
 *   are expected scenario teardown and are not flagged.
 *
 * Backward compatibility:
 *   Traces without qa.phase events fall back to using disk.delete.observed
 *   as a proxy for "intentional user delete" (the old heuristic).
 *
 * Also flags:
 *   - target-role disk.rename.observed with no matching crdt.file.renamed
